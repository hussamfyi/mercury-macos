Looking at the task list, this is only the Mercury X API Authentication component implementation. This is not everything needed to get the full product in users' hands.

  What This Task List Covers

  - OAuth 2.0 + PKCE authentication flow
  - Token management and refresh
  - X API integration for posting tweets
  - Error handling and notifications
  - Rate limiting management
  - UI for authentication setup and management

  What's Missing for Full Product

  Based on the CLAUDE.md context, Mercury is described as "a macOS
  application designed for instant, frictionless idea capture and
  publishing to X" but the current codebase shows it's still mostly
  placeholder content.

  Missing Core Mercury Features:

  1. Text Editor/Input System - The actual journaling/writing
  interface
  2. File Management - Creating, saving, organizing journal entries
  (.md files)
  3. Hotkey System - Global hotkeys for instant capture
  4. Main UI/UX - The core Mercury interface beyond authentication
  5. Entry Management - Creating, editing, deleting journal entries
  6. Search & Organization - Finding and organizing content
  7. Export Features - Beyond X posting (local files, other platforms)
  8. Settings & Preferences - App-wide configuration
  9. Onboarding - First-time user experience (beyond auth setup)
  10. App Store/Distribution - Packaging, signing, distribution

  Integration Dependencies:

  The authentication component assumes Mercury already has:
  - Working text input system
  - Global hotkey handling
  - Core app architecture
  - File management for journal entries

  Recommendation

  You'll need additional PRDs and task lists for:
  1. Core Mercury App (text editing, file management, UI)
  2. Hotkey & Capture System
  3. User Experience & Design System
  4. Distribution & Deployment

  This authentication component is a foundational piece, but Mercury
  needs the core journaling functionality implemented first or in
  parallel for the authentication to have something to integrate with.

> I thought some of these components you're talking about are covered 
  in Phase 5. Please review the Phases carefully. Do I need to create 
  separate PRDs?

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me review the phases more carefully.

  Looking at the task list again, Phase 5 does cover significant
  Mercury app integration:

  What IS Covered in This Task List:

  Phase 3: Main App Integration

  - ContentView.swift updates with authentication awareness
  - Integration with existing Mercury text input and hotkey system
  - AuthManager integration with Mercury's AppState
  - Hotkey posting authentication flows

  Phase 5: User Interface & Experience Implementation

  - Onboarding flow integration (24.0) - Complete onboarding system
  - Main Mercury posting interface integration (29.0) - Text input
  area, posting buttons, keyboard shortcuts, queue status
  - Settings screens (27.0) - Authentication management within Mercury
  - Notification system (25.0) - Error handling UI
  - Status indicators (26.0) - Connection status in Mercury's UI

  What This Assumes Already Exists:

  - Mercury's basic text input system
  - Mercury's hotkey infrastructure
  - Mercury's AppState management
  - Mercury's design language/UI framework
  - Basic Mercury app shell

  What's Still Missing for Full Product:

  1. Core journaling features - Creating/editing/saving journal
  entries
  2. File management system - The actual .md file handling mentioned
  in CLAUDE.md
  3. Mercury's base UI framework - The design system this integrates
  with
  4. Entry organization - Managing multiple journal entries
  5. App distribution - Mac App Store, signing, etc.

  Answer: You likely need one additional PRD for:

  "Mercury Core Journaling Application" - covering the base text
  editing, file management, and core app functionality that this
  authentication component integrates with.

  The authentication PRD is quite comprehensive for its scope, but it
  assumes Mercury's foundation already exists.

> Is there anything in the current task list that might be better for 
  us to hold off on until we create this 2nd PRD?

⏺ Yes, there are several tasks that should be held off until the core
  Mercury PRD is created:

  Tasks to Hold Off On:

  Phase 3: Main App Integration (Tasks 15.0-18.0)

  Why: These assume Mercury's core architecture exists
  - 15.3: "Integrate posting functionality with existing Mercury text
  input and hotkey system"
  - 15.5: "Create two-way data bindings between AuthenticationState
  and Mercury AppState components"
  - 15.6: "Test integration compatibility with existing AppState
  management patterns"
  - 15.7: "Implement and test hotkey posting authentication flow
  triggering"

  Phase 5: UI Integration Tasks

  - 24.0: Onboarding Flow Integration - Assumes Mercury has an
  existing onboarding system
  - 29.0: Main Mercury Posting Interface Integration - Heavily
  dependent on Mercury's main UI existing
    - 29.1: "Update main text input area with subtle authentication
  status indicators"
    - 29.4: "Add authentication-aware keyboard shortcuts and global
  hotkeys"

  What We Should Focus On First:

  Phase 1: CLI Tool Validation ✅

  Keep as-is - Standalone validation, no Mercury dependencies

  Phase 2: Core Authentication System ✅

  Keep as-is - Self-contained authentication infrastructure that
  Mercury can integrate with later

  Modified Phase 3: Minimal Integration

  Keep only:
  - Basic AuthManager setup and initialization
  - Simple state management without deep Mercury integration
  - Basic notification system (standalone)

  Skip for Now:

  - Deep Mercury UI integration
  - Hotkey system integration
  - Main interface modifications
  - Onboarding integration

  Recommended Approach:

  1. Complete Phases 1-2 (standalone authentication system)
  2. Create Mercury Core PRD (text editing, file management, hotkeys,
  main UI)
  3. Return to complete Phases 3-6 with proper Mercury foundation

  This way, you'll have a working, testable authentication system that
   can be integrated once Mercury's core exists, rather than building
  integration points to non-existent systems.
